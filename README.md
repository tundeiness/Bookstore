## About The Project
This is the Frontend implementation of the bookstore project commissioned by Magic-books
Inc (Magic-books is based in Germany). I and my partner at Microverse has been
requested to build both the front-end and the back-end of an application that
will help Magic-books organize and manage their bookstore. The application is required to be fast,
dynamic and responsive to their actions. As a result, my partner and I decided to settle with
building it with React & Redux at the frontend. The Back-end
repository of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/tundeiness/Bookstore).
